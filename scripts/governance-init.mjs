// The trap this closes: a repo copied from the template inherits its `governance/config.json`, which says

// drift-gate stays green while the copy silently owns its own private fork of the core and never receives
// a single update again. Nothing would ever have said so. This command rewrites the config, re-attributes
// every governed file to the layer that really owns it, and pins it — without deleting anything.
