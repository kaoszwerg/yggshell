 * Tells the user that the PREVIOUS run crashed, and where the report is (ADR-CORE-037, ADR-APP-032).
 *
 * This is the backstop behind the native message box. A process that dies before it has a window — or
 * on a desktop with no dialog binary to call — cannot show the user anything at the time. The crash
 * still left a marker on disk, so the next launch is where they finally learn about it. Without this,
 * a startup crash is exactly the "binary that exits with no output" ADR-CORE-037 exists to prevent.
 *
 * The marker is consumed by the backend on read, so the notice appears once and does not nag.
