# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (ADR-CORE-024).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Bootstrapped `saga-rust-template` into **YggShell**: identity `YggShell` /
  `com.kaoszwerg.yggshell` in `app.identity.json`, propagated by `identity:sync` to all 8 derived
  locations; version reset to `0.1.0`; CHANGELOG reset.
- New app icon: Yggdrasil as a rune-stave standing on a shell prompt (`src-tauri/icons/icon.svg`),
  rasterized into the desktop icon set.

### Fixed

- `src-tauri/examples/crash_probe.rs` still referenced the old crate as `saga_rust_template_lib`:
  `sync-identity.mjs` does not cover `src-tauri/examples/`, so `cargo clippy --all-targets` broke
  after the rename. (The script fix belongs upstream — see `.claude/memory/open-work-backlog.md`.)
- `README.md` claimed Node >= 22 while `package.json#engines` requires >= 20.19.

### Removed

- Template-creation artifacts: `docs/howto/new-project-from-template.md`, the `/bootstrap` command,
  and the "Create a project from this template" section of the README.
- Mobile icon assets emitted by `tauri icon` (`src-tauri/icons/android/`, `ios/`, `64x64.png`) —
  unreferenced by `tauri.conf.json` on a desktop-only app.
